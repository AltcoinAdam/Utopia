Utopia: Education of True Truth
======

<a href=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=702380.0>eUtopium (UPM)</a> (<a href=https://www.twitter.com/eutopium>@eUtopium</a>) was designed by <a href=https://www.twitter.com/altcoinadam>@AltcoinAdam</a>, manifested by <a href=https://twitter.com/cryptokeymaker>@CryptoKeymaker</a>.
In this reality, this, is Proof-of-Utopia (PoU). 
eUtopium was built solely upon the <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RzA2U30g46PY2B16OYDZFh3yJrQfhIjOJ6-wQu6C1w/edit?usp=sharing>Proof-of-Utopia (PoU) Thesis</a>,
while exact specifications were designed in collaboration with 
Quantum Holdings (<a href=https://twitter.com/qtmholdings>@QTMHoldings</a>) & the Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication (<a href=http://eshcc.eur.nl>ESHCC</a>).

eUtopium is fully owned by Utopia.

Utopium will be the <b>first-ever self-sustaining, crowdsourced & crowdfunded</b> cryptocurrency project, 
which acts as a <i>social enterprise & social experiment</i> for <b>education</b>. 
One with an infinite goal of attaining Utopia through the act of first seeking, then teaching true truth.

<i>"In a World where only Truth can prevail,
Perception is everything,
because there are Multiple truths,
as much as there are Multiple Dimensions within One Universe."</i>
~ Adam of Eve, @AltcoinAdam

<i>“Because life is an experiment, Utopia is an ongoing project. 
eUtopium will provide the necessary data, experiments, and knowledge
required to write a thesis at the end of 1 year from here.
This thesis will be one academic paper falling under the Utopian arm of education, 
adding onto a library of whitepapers of truth and knowledge that already exist. 
Furthermore, eUtopium will represent the experiment, project, and life, in and of itself. 
eUtopium, will be my Utopia, where money is not important, where only coins are.”</i>
~ Utopia Manifested, @Utopium_
